# PSReaper

Control reaper using PowerShell.

I have literally no idea why anyone would want this, But I'm bored and have nothing to do.

## Get started

This module uses the web remote control of reaper.
Enable it in reaper by going to

```Text
Options -> Preferences
Control/OSC/Web
Add web browser interface and remember the address
```

You can, of course, make connecting easier by using DNS names or something... I don't really care right now.

When done this should also work over network/internet (assuming you have your firewalls and forwarders set up.)

### Implemented so far

* Some basic get commands to reap project and track data.
* one set command to change some track settings.

### Coming soon(ish)

* Project settings, record, playback, loop you name it..

## Disclaimer

This is slow right now. Making it fast is for later.
